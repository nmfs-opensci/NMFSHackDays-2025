    "# Access Data from the Ocean Color Instrument (OCI)\n",

    "> This notebook has the following prerequisites:\n",
    "> - An **<a href=\"https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">Earthdata Login</a>**\n",
    ">   account is required to access data from the NASA Earthdata system, including NASA ocean color data.\n",
    "> - There are no prerequisite notebooks for this module.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we will use the `earthaccess` package to search for\n",
    "OCI products on NASA Earthdata. The `earthaccess` package, published\n",
    "on the [Python Package Index][pypi] and [conda-forge][conda],\n",
    "facilitates discovery and use of all NASA Earth Science data\n",
    "products by providing an abstraction layer for NASAâ€™s [Common\n",
    "Metadata Repository (CMR) API][cmr] and by simplifying requests to\n",
    "NASA's [Earthdata Cloud][edcloud]. Searching for data is more\n",
    "approachable using `earthaccess` than low-level HTTP requests, and\n",
    "the same goes for S3 requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, `earthaccess` helps **authenticate** with Earthdata Login,\n",
    "makes **search** easier, and provides a stream-lined way to **load\n",
    "data** into `xarray` containers. For more on `earthaccess`, visit\n",
    "the [documentation][earthaccess-docs] site. Be aware that\n",
    "`earthaccess` is under active development.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the discussions below on downloading and opening data,\n",
    "we need to clearly understand **where our notebook is\n",
    "running**. There are three cases to distinguish:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The notebook is running on the local host. For instance, you started a Jupyter server on your laptop.\n",
    "1. The notebook is running on a remote host, but it does not have direct access to the NASA Earthdata Cloud. For instance, you are running in [GitHub Codespaces][codespaces].\n",
    "1. The notebook is running on a remote host that does have direct access to the NASA Earthdata Cloud. At this time, we cannot provide a \"for instance\" which is available to everyone.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this notebook you will know:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How to store your NASA Earthdata Login credentials with `earthaccess`\n",
    "* How to use `earthaccess` to search for OCI data using search filters\n",
    "* How to download OCI data, but only when you need to\n",
