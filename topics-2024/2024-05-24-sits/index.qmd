Image: Py-R Geospatial

Summary: The sits package wraps up rstac, gdalcubes, and tmap, with  nice defaults. It works with [7 collections](https://e-sensing.github.io/sitsbook/earth-observation-data-cubes.html?#ard-image-collections-handled-by-sits) which are different combinations of Landsat and Sentinel-2 catalogs.

It has functions for helping with fitting ML models to these data cubes.
