It works with [7 collections](https://e-sensing.github.io/sitsbook/earth-observation-data-cubes.html?#ard-image-collections-handled-by-sits) which are different combinations of Landsat and Sentinel-2 catalogs.\n\nIt has functions for helping with fitting ML models to these data cubes.\n\n# Tutorials\n\n\n* [sits-example.qmd](sits-example.qmd)\n* [sits-setup.qmd](sits-setup.qmd)\n\n\n# Instructions\n\n-   dhub.opensci.live\n-   Select the Py-R geospatial image (default)\n-   Choose 3.7 Gb RAM\n-   Click on the RStudio button\n-   Clone the NOAAHackDays repo\n-   open the https://e-sensing.github.io/sitsbook\n-   Install the sits package `install.packages(\"sits\")`\n\n## How to clone\n\nNever cloned the NOAAHackDays repo?\n\n```         \ncd ~\ngit clone https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/NOAAHackDays\n```\n\nHave cloned it but need to update? This is going to destroy any changes that you made to the repo to make it match the current state of the repo on GitHub.\n\n```  \ncd ~/NOAAHackDays\ngit fetch origin\ngit reset --hard origin/main\n```\n\n",
