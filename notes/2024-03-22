My jupyterhub didn't spin up with rstudio. Just python and desktop. What did I miss?

when starting up the jupyterhub, make sure you select the one says Py-R coastwatch

you need to use the launcher to start Rstudio, then navigate to the rmd file

each node has their own erddap server
and data catalog

RE: values being zero, or Nan, its' important to read metadata first ; metadata will tell you if  some values are flags for certain things like land, lakes, cloud, and no/missing data, etc.

CWUtility is a stand-alone software coastwatch developed you can download and install.  https://coastwatch.noaa.gov/cwn/data-access-tools/coastwatch-utilities.html
