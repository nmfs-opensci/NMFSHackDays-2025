## NOAA Fisheries Training in Ocean Data and Cloud Computing

These are the support pages for the NMFS Open Science resources that support training in data science for the earth and life sciences at NOAA Fisheries. 

* JupyterHub information and orientation pages
* Tutorials from our HackDays
* Links to workshops

We provide technical and infrastructure support for any groups within NOAA Fisheries who would like computing support for their workshops or trainings; See our [training page](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/nmfs-hq-st-open-science/trainings) (NOAA internal). In September 2024, we launched a [JupyterHub](content/jhub.html) with a variety of specialized computing environments tailored to needs in fisheries and ocean modeling. We also support the development of a [Docker stack](https://nmfs-opensci.github.io/container-images/) tailored to R and Python workflows. We run regular workshops and trainings in reproducible science. See [NMFS Openscapes](https://nmfs-openscapes.github.io/) and [NMFS Open Science](https://nmfs-opensci.github.io/). If at NOAA see our [internal site](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/nmfs-hq-st-open-science/open-science) and the tabs for News and Training.
