### More earth data tutorials to explore!

The content and tutorials is a mix of content from workshops by the [NASA Openscapes mentors](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io) (for example [2023 Cloud AGU Workshop](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2023-Cloud-Workshop-AGU/)), content developed by Carl Boettiger for NASA TOPS-T [Cloud Native Geospatial in R & Python](https://boettiger-lab.github.io/nasa-topst-env-justice/), content by [NMFS CoastWatch](https://github.com/coastwatch-training/CoastWatch-Tutorials), and other internal and external tutorials.


How do I get these tutorials into the JupyterHub? clone this [https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/](https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/) and then look in the examples folder.

How do I clone? Since these are Jupyter/Python notebooks, easiest is cloning via JupyterLab.

* Go to JupyterLab. How? I closed the tab. Open the JupyterHub url again.
* Click on the little file icon on left until you are at the home directory.
* Click on the little Git icon on left. Which is it? Click on all the icons until you find it.
* When you see the 'Clone repository' button, click that. Paste in the url of the GitHub repo.  I don't see 'Clone repository'. Go back to step 1. You are not in the home directory yet.


### FAQ

* Can I bring my own content/code to the event and JupyterHub? Absolutely, please do!! You can clone a GitHub repo or just upload files into the hub.
