### Non-NOAA

Recording of the sessions will be posted to this website and all content is open source in the [NOAAHackDays 2025](https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/NOAAHackDays/tree/main/topics-2025) repo.

## Overview

The the era of big data in the earth sciences is here and learning how to effectively use ocean big data, both in the cloud and on your computer, is a core skill for modern fisheries science and management. Learning how to access cloud-based data, visualize these data, use these data in models, and use the tools of modern reproducible and collaborative science is the main goal of these hackhour events. Through these events, participants will gain experience with assessing ocean big data in the cloud, R and RStudio, Python and Jupyter notebooks, and collaborating with Git and GitHub. 

## Aims and Objectives

* Learn how to discover and use ocean data, esp 'big data' (remote-sensing, acoustics, image, sensor)
* Familiarize participants with using ocean data in R and Python with code. 
* Obtain hands-on experience in using ocean data for various science applications.
* Learn by working together and going through .
