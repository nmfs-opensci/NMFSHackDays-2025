title: OPeNDAP - Python
---

In this session, you will get an introduction to accessing data on data servers that provide [OPeNDAP](https://www.opendap.org/) for data access. [What is OPeNDAP](https://www.opendap.org/about/what-is-opendap/)? "OPeNDAP is the commonly used name for a discipline-neutral data access protocol (DAP) thatâ€™s widely utilized both to access and to provide data over the internet. You will find lots of data servers that use OPeNDAP.

Note, these tutorials are narrowly focused on an `xarray` workflow. The goal is to create a lazy (no data loaded) `xarray` data cubes via `open_dataset` and `open_mfdataset` functions.

If you use NASA data, they are migrating to serving their data to the cloud and you should look at the `earthaccess` examples for data access. If you use NOAA data, they use a lot of ERDDAP servers, which are built off OPeNDAP but have some extra features. Go to the ERDDAP examples. If your data are somewhere in a cloud-native format (Zarr, geotiff) use that. That is going to be a lot easier (and faster) to work with for the xarray workflows that I focus in the 2025 HackDays tutorials. 

## Tutorials

* Simple example 1 with no authentication needed. [NCEP-NCAR](1-ncep-ncar.html)
* Simple example 2 with no authentication needed. [Delaware Bay Operational Forecast System ](2-dbofs.html)
* NASA OPeNDAP servers, authentication needed. [NASA OPeNDAP](3-earthdata-auth.html)
* NSIDC serviers, authentication needed. Working on this. Lots of problems with redirects.

## Servers that use NASA Earthdata authentication

Things with `nasa.gov` are obvious but a couple others without nasa.gov in the url also use it.
