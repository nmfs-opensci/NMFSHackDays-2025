# Info for Contributors

## Rebuilding GitHub Pages

Pages are served from main branch on docs folder.

```
remotes::install_deps(dependencies=TRUE, upgrade="always")
```
Then Render in a terminal **from RStudio server** with

```
quarto render
````
Don't run this in Jupyter Lab terminal because any R code that gets rerun (is not cached) will fail because it will try to use GDAL installed in conda environment and that is incompatible with the R spatial packages. The Jupyter notebooks are pre-run in Jupyter Lab so are not ever re-run.

## Adding download links

This is used https://github.com/shafayetShafee/downloadthis

Format is `{{< downloadthis 0-earthdata-catalog.ipynb dname=“0-earthdata-catalog.ipynb” >}}`

## Images

So that external images appear if the user downloads the notebooks, use full links to images like
